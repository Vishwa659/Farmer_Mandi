          <h3>Chia Seeds</h3>
          <p>Chia seeds are tiny superfoods loaded with omegaâ€‘3 fatty acids, fiber, protein, and essential minerals like calcium and phosphorus. When soaked in liquid, chia seeds absorb up to 10x their weight, creating a gel-like consistency thatâ€™s perfect for puddings, smoothies, and overnight oats. Their high soluble fiber content aids digestion, supports steady blood sugar levels, and promotes a feeling of fullnessâ€”ideal for healthy snacking. Additionally, chiaâ€™s omegaâ€‘3s support heart and brain health. Naturally gluten-free and plant-based, these versatile seeds are texture-rich and easy to add to baked goods, cereals, and dressings for a nutritional edge.</p>
