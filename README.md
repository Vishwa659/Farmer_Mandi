# 🌾 Farmer Mandi - Empowering Farmers, One Order at a Time

## 🚜 About the Project

**Farmer Mandi** is a web application designed to help farmers avoid potential losses caused by broker chains. Instead of profits being split among multiple middlemen, our platform connects **farmers directly with large-scale buyers** (like hotels, restaurants, and stores), ensuring better prices for producers and fair rates for buyers.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

* Farmers often sell their produce at minimal rates to brokers.
* A series of intermediaries increase the cost of goods, benefiting themselves, not the farmers.
* This makes the final product **more expensive** for consumers too.
* **Small-scale buyers** are not the current focus — this is designed for **bulk purchases**.

## 💡 Vision & Goals

* Provide a **transparent platform** for bulk buyers to connect directly with farmers.
* **Eliminate middlemen**, leading to better pricing for both parties.
* Ensure quality, quantity, and product details are clearly available to buyers.
* Help farmers gain more **profit and visibility** for their hard work.

## 🚧 Current Status

* 🛠️ Still in the **building phase**.
* Learning and integrating new skills fast to build a reliable backend and frontend system.
* Implementing authentication, local storage, SQLite databases, and Express APIs.

## 🔮 Future Plans

* Add **farmer profiles**, product details, and quality info.
* Allow buyers to browse and place **bulk orders** directly from farmers.
* Build dashboards for both buyers and sellers.
* Integrate **order tracking** and communication features.
